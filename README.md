TITLE :IPL Analysis using Machine learning models

 objective: In todayâ€™s date data analysis is need for every data analytics to examine the sets of data to extract the
useful information from it and to draw conclusion according to the information. Data analytics techniques and
algorithms are more used by the commercial industries which enables them to take precise business decisions. It is also
used by the analysts and the experts to authenticate or negate experimental layouts, assumptions and conclusions. In
recent years the analytics is being used in the field of sports to predict and draw various insights. Due to the
involvement of money, team spirit, city loyalty and a massive fan following, the outcome of matches is very important
for all stake holders

The steps involved in the project are:

1. exploring the dataset also visualizing as well as cleaning the data set .

2. Data preprocessing

3. building machine learning models

4. evaluating the models

5.tuning the parameters for better accuracy

6.upsampling- Upsampling (balanced): decide how many times the sample size of the minority class wants to be used and perform sampling with replacement in the minority class and sampling without replacement in the majority class.

7.final model creation and analysis outcome.
